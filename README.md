# GraviQ: Simulating Subsurface Mapping with a Qubit-Based Gravimeter


Our project simulates how a cold-atom–based quantum gravimeter could be used for subsurface mapping entirely in software. We will begin by constructing a simplified subsurface model in which we assign densities to points in a 1D line or 2D grid, introducing features such as low-density voids or high-density ore regions.
